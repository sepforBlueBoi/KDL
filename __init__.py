#init file lol
#also notes, and planning :), cause i like having a bit of...fancy in my code
#to find the import routing check the nexus file, eh?
"""so, why notes in __init__? well my dear reader. init files are needed 
for initialation for packages, but i want some pazazz, so nexus for imports, and init for plans and packaging. 
two birds one stone, 'but its weird!', i simple dont care, also it doesnt hurt nothing
